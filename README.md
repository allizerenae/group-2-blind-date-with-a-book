#Introduction

Project Objective
The goal of Blind Date with a Book is to build a command line interface tool that helps a book club admin select the clubâ€™s next read. The app integrates with the Open Library API, stores reading history in an SQL database, and automatically sets reading deadlines.

Project Solution
This app streamlines decision-making for book clubs, keeping monthly selections fun, fair, and organized, while saving admins valuable time.

#Background
App Workflow

Fetch book details from Open Library API

Save book with assigned date + deadline in SQL database

View Current Book and Deadline

Displays current book details + reading deadline

View Book History

Shows previous selections with deadlines and genres

# API used: Open Library API
